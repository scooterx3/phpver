For apache servers where the binaries are already in place, this script modifies the .htaccess file and adds a php.ini for whichever version of PHP you might select.

Built for shared hosts which use php 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, along with php 5.2 fcgi and 5.4 fcgi. You may need to adjust the addHandler and binary paths though based on your setup. Check with your hosting support / administrator.
